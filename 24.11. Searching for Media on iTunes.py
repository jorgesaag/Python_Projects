#You’ve already seen an example using the iTunes API in Generating Request URLs.
#The iTunes API allows users to search for movies, podcasts, music, music videos, tv shows, and books that are hosted
#on the iTunes site. You can explore the official iTunes API documentation.
#Earlier we showed a possible query for podcasts about Ann Arbor. Now, we’ll show you how to construct it yourself!
#We will first need to write our import statements, so that we have access to the requests module and json module.

import requests
import json

#At this point, we look to our documentation to find out what the base of the url will be as well as what parameters
#are neeed to construct the request. In the Searching section of the documentation, we can see that the url should be
#in the form of https://itunes.apple.com/search?parameterkeyvalue so we know the base url should be
#https://itunes.apple.com/search. To determine what parameters are necessary, we can look at the table in the
#documentation to learn what parameter keys and values will be understood by the iTuens API server.
#term is a required parameter with no default value, so we’ll have to provide that.

#Look at the iTunes API documentation.
#If we’re looking for podcasts originating in Ann Arbor, what value should be associated with the key “term”?

import requests
import json

params = {"term":        }

#We also want to make sure that we’re searching for podcasts.
#Look at the iTunes API documentation. What is the key we need to use to only search for podcasts?

import requests
import json

params = {      : "podcast"}

#Note that both entity and media are parameters we can use for this task. Entity can be more specific though, so you may
#need to use that in rather than media! Now, our code can now make a request to the iTunes API.
#We’re using the request_with_caching module and providing a cached response to the query in the activecodes.
#You can try running different queries, but if the itunes webserver is inaccessible to you for one reason or another,
#it may not work.

import requests_with_caching
import json

parameters = {"term": "Ann Arbor", "entity": "podcast"}
iTunes_response = requests_with_caching.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search", params = parameters,permanent_cache_file="itunes_cache.txt")

py_data = json.loads(iTunes_response.text)

#With that result in hand, you will have to go through the process previously described as Understand. Extract. Repeat.
#For example, to print out the names of all the podcasts returned, one could run the following code.

import requests_with_caching
import json

parameters = {"term": "Ann Arbor", "entity": "podcast"}
iTunes_response = requests_with_caching.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search", params = parameters, permanent_cache_file="itunes_cache.txt")

py_data = json.loads(iTunes_response.text)
for r in py_data['results']:
    print(r['trackName'])
