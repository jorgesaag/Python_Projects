#One more common pattern with lists, besides accumulation, is to step through a pair of lists (or several lists),
#doing something with all of the first items, then something with all of the second items, and so on.
#For example, given two lists of numbers, you might like to add them up pairwise, taking [3, 4, 5]
#and [1, 2, 3] to yield [4, 6, 8]. One way to do that with a for loop is to loop through the possible index values.

L1 = [3, 4, 5]
L2 = [1, 2, 3]
L3 = []

for i in range(len(L1)):
    L3.append(L1[i] + L2[i])

print(L3)

#You have seen this idea previously for iterating through the items in a single list.
#In many other programming languages that’s really the only way to iterate through the items in a list.
#In Python, however, we have gotten used to the for loop where the iteration variable is bound successively
#to each item in the list, rather than just to a number that’s used as a position or index into the list.
#Can’t we do something similar with pairs of lists? It turns out we can. The zip function takes multiple lists
#and turns them into a list of tuples (actually, an iterator, but they work like lists for most practical purposes),
#pairing up all the first items as one tuple, all the second items as a tuple, and so on.
#Then we can iterate through those tuples, and perform some operation on all the first items,
#all the second items, and so on.

L1 = [3, 4, 5]
L2 = [1, 2, 3]
L4 = list(zip(L1, L2))
print(L4)

#Here’s what happens when you loop through the tuples.

L1 = [3, 4, 5]
L2 = [1, 2, 3]
L3 = []
L4 = list(zip(L1, L2))

for (x1, x2) in L4:
    L3.append(x1+x2)

print(L3)

#Or, simplifying and using a list comprehension:

L1 = [3, 4, 5]
L2 = [1, 2, 3]
L3 = [x1 + x2 for (x1, x2) in list(zip(L1, L2))]
print(L3)

#Or, using map and not unpacking the tuple (our online environment has trouble with
#unpacking the tuple in a lambda expression):

L1 = [3, 4, 5]
L2 = [1, 2, 3]
L3 = map(lambda x: x[0] + x[1], zip(L1, L2))
print(L3)

#Consider a function called possible, which determines whether a word is still possible to play in a game
#of hangman, given the guesses that have been made and the current state of the blanked word.
#Below we provide function that fulfills that purpose.

    if len(word) != len(blanked):
