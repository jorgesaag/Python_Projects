#Consider another service, the image sharing site flickr. People interact with the site using a web browser or mobile apps.
#Users who upload photos can assign one or more short “tags” to each photo. Tags are words like “sunset” or “spaghetti”
#that describe something about the photo. They can be used for searching or finding related photos.

#An API is available to make it easier for application programs to fetch data from the site and post data to the site.
#That allows third parties to make applications that integrate elements of flickr. Flickr provides the API as a way to
#increase the value of its service, and thus attract more customers. You can explore the official documentation about
#the site.

#Here we will explore some aspects of one endpoint that flickr provides, for searching for photos matching certain criteria.
#Check out the full documentation for photo search for details.

#This API is more complex than the APIs you examined in previous subchapters, because it requires authentication,
#and because it requires you to specify that you want results to be returned in JSON format.
#It also provide more good practice at learning to use an API from the documentation.
#Plus, photo data is pretty interesting to examine.

#The structure of a URL for a photo search on flickr is:

# 1) base URL is https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/
# 2) ?
# 3) key=value pairs, separated by &s:
#                  *One pair is method=flickr.photos.search. This says to do a photo search, rather than one of the many
#                  other operations that the API allows. Don’t be confused by the word “method” here– it is not a python
#                  method. That’s just the name flickr uses to distinguish among the different operations a client
#                  application can request.
#                  *format=json. This says to return results in JSON format.
#                  *per_page=5. This says to return 5 results at a time.
#                  *tags=mountains,river. This says to return things that are tagged with “mountains” and “river”.
#                  *tag_mode=all. This says to return things that are tagged with both mountains and river.
#                  *media=photos. This says to return photos
#                  *api_key=.... Flickr only lets authorized applications access the API. Each request must include a
#                  secret code as a value associated with api_key. Anyone can get a key. See the documentation for how
#                  to get one. We recommend that you get one so that you can test out the sample code in this chapter
#                  creatively. We have included some cached responses, and they are accessible even without an API key.
#                  *nojsoncallback=1. This says to return the raw JSON result without a function wrapper around the JSON
#                  response.

#Let’s put everything together to make a little retrieval tool for flickr images containing particular tags.
#Of course, in a browser, you can just use flickr’s search tool. But doing this through the API opens up other
#possibilities that you can explore for features not provided on the regular flickr website.

#Below is some code that queries the flickr API for images that have a particular tag:

#Note: Searching for “mountains” and “rivers” usually produces beautiful images that are “safe for work”, so the
#example below does that search. We have already cached a response for the particular search in the code window below.
#That allows the code to run even if you don’t provide a valid flickr api_key. We’ve also checked to make sure that the
#five returned images are indeed safe for work. If you run this code outside of a browser, or if you do other searches,
#you will need to provide a valid flickr api_key.

# import statements
import requests_with_caching
import json
# import webbrowser

# apply for a flickr authentication key at http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?
# paste the key (not the secret) as the value of the variable flickr_key
flickr_key = 'yourkeyhere'

def get_flickr_data(tags_string):
    baseurl = "https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/"
    params_diction = {}
    params_diction["api_key"] = flickr_key # from the above global variable
    params_diction["tags"] = tags_string # must be a comma separated string to work correctly
    params_diction["tag_mode"] = "all"
    params_diction["method"] = "flickr.photos.search"
    params_diction["per_page"] = 5
    params_diction["media"] = "photos"
    params_diction["format"] = "json"
    params_diction["nojsoncallback"] = 1
    flickr_resp = requests_with_caching.get(baseurl, params = params_diction, permanent_cache_file="flickr_cache.txt")
    # Useful for debugging: print the url! Uncomment the below line to do so.
    print(flickr_resp.url) # Paste the result into the browser to check it out...
    return flickr_resp.json()

result_river_mts = get_flickr_data("river,mountains")

# Some code to open up a few photos that are tagged with the mountains and river tags...

photos = result_river_mts['photos']['photo']
for photo in photos:
    owner = photo['owner']
    photo_id = photo['id']
    url = 'https://www.flickr.com/photos/{}/{}'.format(owner, photo_id)
    print(url)
    # webbrowser.open(url)

#The response sent back by flickr is loaded into a python dictionary using json.loads(). In the end, we loop through
#the list of photo dictionaries that were returned, extracting two fields, owner and photo_id. Those are used to create
#new URLs that are in the format flickr expects for displaying a webpage containing a single image.
#In the runestone environment, you’ll have to copy those URLs to new tabs to see the photos.
#In a full python environment, you can uncomment the line of code that imports the webbrowser module and the line
#of code that calls the webbrowser.open() function. If all goes well, that should open five browser tabs, each with a
#picture that some flickr user had tagged with the words “mountains” and “rivers”.
